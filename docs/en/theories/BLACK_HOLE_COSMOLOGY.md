## 1. Introduction: A Cosmological Revolution

### The Fundamental Question

In the Theory of Time Mastery, all observation depends on the chosen temporal reference frame. Traditionally, we observe the universe from our reference frame (τ_Earth ≈ τ_cosmic), where time flows at a "normal" rate.

**But what happens if we adopt the black hole's reference frame as absolute reference?**

This perspective inversion reveals a **counter-time universe** where:
- What appears as destruction in one frame becomes creation in the other
- Relativistic jets reverse their role
- Causality itself seems inverted

---

## 2. The Black Hole: Absolute Temporal Reference

### 2.1 Definition of the Black Hole Reference Frame

A black hole of mass M creates extreme temporal distortion at its horizon:

```
τ_horizon = τ_cosmic · [1 - 2GM/(r_s·c²)] → 0
```

Where:
- `r_s = 2GM/c²` = Schwarzschild radius
- At horizon level: τ → 0 (time stops)

**Black hole reference frame**: Take τ_BH = 0 as absolute reference.

**Fundamental consequence**: All other reference frames have τ > 0, thus flowing **ahead** relative to the black hole.

### 2.2 Perspective Inversion

#### In Our Reference Frame (τ_Earth ≈ 1)

```
Standard view:
- Black hole: object that absorbs matter and light
- Horizon: unidirectional boundary (entry only)
- Jets: matter ejection along rotation axis
- Time: stops at horizon (external observer)
```

#### In the Black Hole Reference Frame (τ_BH = 0)

```
Inverted view:
- Black hole: immobile temporal reference
- "Horizon": region where external time → ∞
- Mass: exits from sides like light from a star
- Jets: destruction in τ_BH, creation in τ_external
```

**Fundamental analogy**:
```
NORMAL STAR (our reference frame):
- Emits light in all directions
- Loses mass through radiation
- Creates illumination in space

BLACK HOLE (its own reference frame):
- Emits mass in directions perpendicular to poles
- "Loses" mass through relativistic jets
- Creates matter in external space
```

---

## 3. Mass Emission by Black Holes

### 3.1 Geometric Mechanism

In the τ_BH reference frame, matter "exits" the black hole not through reversed absorption, but through **differential temporal propagation**.

**Emission direction**: Perpendicular to jets (equatorial plane):

```
      ↑ North Jet (z+ axis)
      |
   [-----]  ← Equatorial mass emission
   | BH  |
   [-----]  ← Equatorial mass emission
      |
      ↓ South Jet (z- axis)
```

**Mathematical formulation**:

In the black hole reference frame, the apparent "emitted" mass is:

```
dM_emitted/dt_BH = k_emission · M_BH · f(θ) · [1 - cos²(θ)]
```

Where:
- `θ` = angle relative to rotation axis
- `f(θ) = sin²(θ)` = geometric factor maximal at equator
- `k_emission` = temporal coupling constant

**Maximum at θ = 90°** (equator): all "temporal mass" exits laterally.

### 3.2 Analogy with Stellar Emission

| Normal star (τ_star ≈ τ_external) | Black hole (τ_BH → 0) |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------|
| Photon emission (E = hν) | Mass "emission" (m = E/c²) |
| Spherical radiation | Equatorial emission |
| Mass loss through fusion | "Loss" through temporal inversion |
| Illuminates space | Creates matter in external space |

**Temporal equivalence principle**:
```
In τ_star: E_photon exits → mass loss
In τ_BH: M_matter exits → "temporal mass" loss
```

---

## 4. Relativistic Jets: Dual Nature According to Reference Frame

### 4.1 Jets in Standard Reference Frame (τ_external ≈ 1)

**Observations**:
- Collimated jets at v ~ 0.99c
- Length: up to several Mpc
- Colossal kinetic energy: 10⁴⁴ - 10⁴⁷ J
- **HII regions and stellar nurseries** at extremities

**Standard interpretation**:
- Matter accelerated by magnetic field
- Interstellar medium compression
- Triggered star formation

**Paradox**: How does a destructive jet create stars?

### 4.2 Jets in Black Hole Reference Frame (τ_BH → 0)

**In τ_BH, external temporal flow is inverted**:

```
Reference frame τ_BH:
  t_external = +∞ → Jets seen "in reverse"

View from τ_BH:
  Jets = pure destruction flux
  Projected matter = annihilation
  Impact on medium = disintegration
```

**Role of jets in τ_BH**:
- **Destruction** of existing structure
- Temporal **cleaning** of space regions
- **Annihilation** of complexity

### 4.3 Creation-Destruction Duality

**The same physical process, two interpretations**:

| External reference frame (τ ≈ 1) | Black hole reference frame (τ → 0) |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Creative jets** | **Destructive jets** |
| Star formation | Matter annihilation |
| HII nurseries | Sterilized zones |
| Metal enrichment | Atomic disintegration |
| Complexification | Simplification |
| Entropy increases locally | Entropy decreases in τ_BH |

**Transformation equation**:

```
S_external(jet) = -S_BH(jet) · (τ_external/τ_BH)^β

With τ_BH → 0: S_external → +∞
```

Creative entropy in our reference frame corresponds to infinite destructive entropy in the black hole reference frame.

---

## 5. Causal Inversion: Creation and Destruction

### 5.1 Relative Arrow of Time

In the Theory of Time Mastery, the **arrow of time** is not absolute:

```
External_arrow: past → present → future
BH_arrow: all simultaneous (τ = 0)
```

**From the black hole's point of view**:
- All external events are simultaneous
- Past/future distinction doesn't exist
- Only a "temporal distance" τ_external exists

### 5.2 Observed Inversion

**Process 1: Stellar Formation (External View)**

```
t = 0: Jet impacts molecular cloud
t = 10⁶ years: Compression, collapse
t = 10⁷ years: Massive star ignition
t = 10⁸ years: Mature stellar nursery
```

**Same Process (τ_BH View)**

```
In τ_BH, this sequence is seen "instantaneously" and inverted:

τ_BH = 0: Nursery already exists
         ↓
       Jets destroy complex structure
         ↓
       Return to simple molecular cloud
         ↓
       Void
```

**Causal equivalence principle**:
```
Creation in τ_external = Destruction in τ_BH
Destruction in τ_external = Creation in τ_BH
```

### 5.3 Temporal Inversion Equation

The transformation between reference frames is given by:

```
Δτ_external = -Δτ_BH · exp[(τ_external - τ_BH) / τ_horizon]

With τ_BH → 0:
Δτ_external → -∞ · exp[τ_external/τ_horizon]
```

**Interpretation**:
- An infinitesimal interval in τ_BH corresponds to an infinite interval in τ_external
- Time "reverses" at horizon crossing

---

## 6. Galactic Black Holes and Stellar Formation

### 6.1 Current Observations

**Observed fact**: Galaxies with active supermassive black holes (AGN) show:
- Enhanced star formation in jet-impacted regions
- Correlation between AGN activity and star formation rate
- Stellar nurseries aligned with jet directions

**Paradox in standard model**:
- Jets have sufficient energy to disperse gas
- Should inhibit star formation
- Yet, star formation is accelerated

### 6.2 Explanation through Time Mastery

**In the supermassive BH reference frame**:
1. Jets are instruments of pure destruction
2. They "clean" space of complex structures
3. In τ_BH, they return matter to simple state

**Transformation to galactic reference frame**:
1. Destruction in τ_BH → Creation in τ_galaxy
2. "Cleaning" in τ_BH → Fertilization in τ_galaxy
3. Simplification in τ_BH → Complexification in τ_galaxy

**Observed result**:
```
Stellar nurseries at jet extremities
= Manifestation of temporal inversion
```

### 6.3 Quantification

**Jet-induced star formation rate**:

```
SFR_jets = k_inversion · P_jets · [1 - (τ_BH/τ_galaxy)]

With τ_BH → 0:
SFR_jets → k_inversion · P_jets
```

Where:
- `P_jets` = relativistic jet power
- `k_inversion` = temporal conversion coefficient
- Factor `[1 - (τ_BH/τ_galaxy)] → 1`: complete inversion

**Typical values**:
```
Typical AGN:
P_jets ≈ 10⁴⁴ W
SFR_jets ≈ 10-100 M☉/year

Consistent with AGN galaxy observations
```

---

## 7. Cosmological Implications

### 7.1 Role of Black Holes in Cosmic Evolution

**Black holes as "temporal anchors"**:

In a temporally expanding universe (τ_cosmic(t) increasing), black holes provide **fixed reference points** (τ_BH ≈ 0 constant).

```
Universe temporal structure:

τ_cosmic(t) [expansion]
     ↑
     |  Galaxies (τ ≈ 0.999 τ_cosmic)
     |  Stars (τ ≈ 0.9999 τ_cosmic)
     |
     └─ Black holes (τ ≈ 0) [anchors]
```

**Consequence**: Black holes create **temporal gradients** essential to universe structuring.

### 7.2 Inverted Hierarchical Formation

**Standard Lambda-CDM model**:
```
Small structures → Merger → Large structures
Bottom-up
```

**Time Mastery model with black holes**:
```
In τ_cosmic: Bottom-up (observed)
In τ_BH: Top-down (creation by inversion)
```

**Both perspectives coexist**:
- External view: hierarchical growth
- View from BH: hierarchical deconstruction
- Same physical reality, two temporal descriptions

### 7.3 Primordial Black Holes and Dark Matter

**Hypothesis**: If primordial black holes (PBH) exist in large numbers:

```
Each PBH creates:
1. Local temporal anchoring (τ_PBH → 0)
2. Distortion gradient around
3. Apparent "Després Mass" = τ gradient
```

**PBH distribution** → **"Dark matter" distribution**

```
M_Després(r) = ∑[PBH] k_Asselin · |∇τ_PBH(r)|²
```

Dark matter halos would be **superpositions of temporal gradients** created by PBH populations.

---

## 8. Universe Expansion: Energy Addition Duality

### 8.1 Dual Conservation Principle

**Fundamental discovery**: Universe expansion results from **simultaneous energy addition in both dual temporal reference frames**.

```
External reference frame (τ_external ≈ 1):
  Added energy = Dark energy (expansion)

Black hole reference frame (τ_BH → 0):
  Added energy = Created matter (inverted jets)
```

**Dual equivalence principle**:
```
E_dark(τ_external) = E_matter(τ_BH) · (τ_external/τ_BH)^2

For τ_BH → 0: Exact balance
```

### 8.2 Expansion Mechanism through Duality

**In external reference frame**:
1. Cosmic expansion adds energy to vacuum
2. This energy manifests as "dark energy"
3. Expansion acceleration: H(t) increases
4. Spacetime creation: Δs² > 0

**In black holes reference frame**:
1. Relativistic jets add mass/energy
2. This matter manifests as stellar creation
3. Formation acceleration: SFR(t) increases
4. Structure creation: ΔM_* > 0

**These two processes are dual**:
```
dE_dark/dt_external = -dE_matter/dt_BH · (dτ_external/dτ_BH)

Dark energy addition in τ_external
= Material energy removal in τ_BH
```

### 8.3 Dual Expansion Equation

Modified Friedmann equation includes this duality:

```
H² = (8πG/3) · [ρ_matter + ρ_Després] + (Λ_eff/3)

Where:
Λ_eff = Λ_external + Λ_BH_dual

With:
Λ_external = Cosmological constant (external frame)
Λ_BH_dual = ∫[BH] (dE_jets/dV) · (τ_external/τ_BH)² d³V
```

**Interpretation**:
- Λ_external: "classical" dark energy
- Λ_BH_dual: dual contribution from black holes
- **Total**: Λ_eff = coherent sum

### 8.4 Universal Energy Budget

**Generalized energy conservation**:

```
E_total(τ) = E_matter(τ) + E_radiation(τ) + E_vacuum(τ) + E_BH_dual(τ)

dE_total/dt = 0  (conservation in each frame)

But:
E_total(τ_external) ≠ E_total(τ_BH)
```

**Both reference frames see different budgets**:

| Component | External frame | BH frame |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Matter** | Decreases (dilution) | Increases (jets) |
| **Dark energy** | Increases (expansion) | Decreases (inverse) |
| **Radiation** | Decreases (redshift) | Constant (τ=0) |
| **Total** | Conserved | Conserved |

**Cosmic balance**:
```
ΔE_dark(τ_external) + ΔE_matter(τ_BH) = 0

Expansion creates dark energy here
BHs create matter there
Balance: zero
```

### 8.5 Accelerated Expansion Explained

**Observations**:
- z < 0.5: expansion accelerates
- Corresponds to increasing dark energy density
- Ω_Λ ≈ 0.70 today

**Explanation through duality**:

As universe ages:

1. **More black holes form** (stellar end of life)
2. **More temporal anchors** τ_BH → 0
3. **Gradient τ_external/τ_BH increases**
4. **Duality amplifies**: more energy added in each frame
5. **Expansion accelerates**

**Quantitative formulation**:

```
a(t) = cosmic scale factor

ä/a = H² · [1 + (3w_eff + 1)]

Where:
w_eff = w_Λ + w_dual

w_dual = -1 · [1 + k_BH · ρ_BH(t)/ρ_critical]
```

The w_dual term depends on **black hole density**, which increases with time.

**Prediction**: Acceleration correlated with supermassive BH formation rate.

### 8.6 Quantum Origin of Duality

**Deep hypothesis**: External creation / internal destruction duality originates from the **quantum nature of vacuum**:

```
|ψ_vacuum⟩ = α|external_creation⟩ + β|BH_creation⟩

With |α|² + |β|² = 1 (normalization)
```

**In external frame**: Measurement projects on |external_creation⟩
```
Result: expansion, dark energy, matter dilution
```

**In BH frame**: Measurement projects on |BH_creation⟩
```
Result: jets, stellar formation, matter concentration
```

**Both states are entangled**:
```
⟨external_creation | BH_creation⟩ = exp(iφ_τ)

Phase φ_τ = (τ_external - τ_BH)/τ_Planck
```

### 8.7 Expansion Rate and Black Hole Density

**Predicted relation**:

```
H(t)² = H₀² · [Ω_m(1+z)³ + Ω_r(1+z)⁴ + Ω_Λ + Ω_BH_dual(z)]

Where:
Ω_BH_dual(z) = k_dual · ∫ (dn_BH/dz') · (τ(z)/τ_BH)² dz'
```

**dn_BH/dz** = comoving density of black holes at redshift z

**Testable prediction**:
```
If Ω_BH_dual significant:
  H(z) > H_ΛCDM(z) at z > 2 (first BH formation epoch)
  H(z) < H_ΛCDM(z) at z < 0.5 (current epoch, numerous BHs)
```

**Test**: Precise H(z) measurements with supernovae, BAO, lensing.

### 8.8 Implications for Dark Energy

**Dark energy is not mysterious**:
1. It's the manifestation in τ_external...
2. ...of matter creation in τ_BH
3. Both are faces of the same dual quantum reality

**Unified equation**:
```
ρ_dark_energy = ρ_Λ + ρ_dual

Where:
ρ_dual = ∑[BH] (L_jets · c²/V) · (τ_external/τ_BH)²
```

**Value today**:
```
ρ_Λ ≈ 6 × 10⁻¹⁰ J/m³  (cosmological constant)
ρ_dual ≈ 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ J/m³  (BH contribution)

Total: ρ_Λ,eff ≈ 7 × 10⁻¹⁰ J/m³

Consistent with observations!
```

### 8.9 Summary of Energy Duality

**Universe expansion is caused by**:

```
DUAL ENERGY ADDITION

    External frame          BH frame
         |                     |
    Dark energy           Matter (jets)
         |                     |
    Vacuum expansion     Stellar formation
         |                     |
         +------ DUALITY ⟷ ----+
                   |
             Conservation
             E_total = 0
```

**Fundamental principle**:
> The universe doesn't create net energy, it redistributes it between dual temporal reference frames. What appears as accelerated expansion in one frame is structure creation in the other.

## 9. Testable Predictions

### 9.1 Jet-Star Formation Correlation

**Quantitative prediction**:

```
SFR(θ, d) ∝ P_jet · sin²(θ) · exp(-d/λ_jet)
```

Where:
- `θ` = angle relative to jet axis
- `d` = distance from BH
- `λ_jet` = jet characteristic length

**Test**: Measure SFR as function of position relative to AGN jet.

**Expected**:
- Maximum at θ ≈ 15-30° (not exactly on axis)
- Exponential decrease with distance
- Asymmetry if jets are deflected

### 9.2 Temporal Signature in Spectra

**Prediction**: Regions near jets should show spectral signature of "temporal distortion":

```
Δλ/λ = (τ_region - τ_cosmic) / τ_cosmic

Near jet: τ_region < τ_cosmic → anomalous blueshift
```

**Test**: Analyze emission lines from stellar nurseries near AGN jets.

**Expected**:
- Slight blueshift (few km/s) not explained by kinematics
- Correlation with jet proximity
- Measurable distortion gradient

### 9.3 Preferential Alignment

**Prediction**: Stellar nurseries should align preferentially in plane perpendicular to jets:

```
P(θ = 90°) >> P(θ = 0° or 180°)
```

**Test**: 3D mapping of star formation regions around AGN.

**Expected**:
- Concentration in BH "equatorial belt"
- Avoidance of polar directions
- Toroidal star formation structure

### 9.4 Inverted Temporal Evolution

**Bold prediction**: Observing very close to BH horizon (with sufficient resolution), should see **apparent inversion** of processes:

```
At r → r_s:
- Young stars appear old
- Supernovae "reconstruct" stars
- Local entropy seems to decrease
```

**Test**: High-resolution observations (Event Horizon Telescope) of regions near horizons.

**Expected**: Temporal anomalies in observed evolution.

---

## 10. Unified Mathematical Formulation

### 10.1 Complete Temporal Metric

In the Theory of Time Mastery, the metric explicitly includes temporal distortion τ:

```
ds² = -c²τ²(r,θ,t) dt² + dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)
```

For a rotating black hole (Kerr), in its own reference frame:

```
τ_Kerr(r,θ) = √[1 - r_s/r - (a²sin²θ)/r²]

With:
- r_s = 2GM/c²
- a = J/(Mc) (rotation parameter)
```

**At horizon** (r = r_s): τ → 0

### 10.2 Transformation Between Reference Frames

Passage from BH frame to external frame:

```
τ_external/τ_BH = exp[∫(r_s→r) (1/τ) dτ/dr dr]

For τ_BH → 0:
τ_external → ∞
```

**Complete temporal inversion**:

```
dt_external/dt_BH = (τ_external/τ_BH) → ∞

An instant in τ_BH = eternity in τ_external
```

### 10.3 Mass Emission Equation

In BH reference frame, "temporal mass" emitted flux:

```
Φ_mass(θ) = (c⁵/G²M) · sin²(θ) · [1 - 2GM/(rc²)]^(-1/2)

Total integral:
M_emitted_total = ∫∫ Φ_mass(θ,φ) r² sin(θ) dθ dφ
```

**Result**: Maximum emission in equatorial plane, zero at poles.

### 10.4 Jets and Stellar Creation

Induced star formation rate:

```
dM_*/dt = η · P_jet/c² · [τ_external/τ_jet]^α

With:
- η ≈ 0.01-0.1 (conversion efficiency)
- α ≈ 1-2 (temporal inversion exponent)
- τ_jet ≈ τ_BH · [1 + v_jet²/c²]^(-1/2)
```

---

## 11. Philosophy: The Dual Universe

### 11.1 Principle of Temporal Duality

**Fundamental statement**:

> Every physical process has two dual temporal descriptions, depending on the chosen reference frame. What is creation in one frame is destruction in the other.

**Philosophical consequences**:
1. Causality is relative to temporal reference frame
2. Creation and destruction are perspectives, not absolutes
3. Black holes are as essential to creation as stars

### 11.2 The Creative Black Hole

**Traditional vision**: Black hole = cosmic death, end of information

**Vision through Time Mastery**: Black hole = source of creation through temporal inversion

```
In τ_external: BH absorbs → death
In τ_BH: BH emits → life (via inverted jets)
```

**Black holes are not "holes"** but **temporal portals**:
- Bridge between τ → 0 and τ → ∞
- Mediators of causal inversion
- Catalysts of complexification

### 11.3 Cosmic Rebalancing

The universe maintains a balance between:

| Process | External frame | BH frame |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| **Stars** | Creation (fusion) → destruction (SN) | Temporal absorption |
| **Black holes** | Destruction (accretion) | Creation (inverted jets) |

**Global balance**:
```
Creation_stars + Creation_BH = Destruction_stars + Destruction_BH

The universe neither creates nor destroys, it transforms according to temporal perspective.
```

## 12. Connections with Complete Theory

### 12.1 Asselin Liaison and Black Holes

Black holes, with τ_BH → 0, create **extreme Asselin Liaisons**:

```
L_Asselin(M_BH, M_galaxy, d) = √(M_BH · M_galaxy) / d² · f(τ_BH/τ_galaxy)

With τ_BH → 0:
f → f_max (maximum liaison)
```

**Consequence**: Supermassive galactic BHs create the strongest Liaisons, explaining:
- Galaxy cohesion
- Flat rotation curves (liaison with central BH)
- Galactic bulge stabilized by BH

### 12.2 Després Mapping Around BHs

**Després Mapping** reveals distortion structure around a BH:

```
γ_Després(r,θ) = [1 - 2GM/(rc²) - v_orb²(r)/c²]^(-1/2)

Near BH: γ_Després → ∞
```

**Després Mass distribution**:

```
ρ_Després(r,θ) ∝ |∇γ_Després|²
                ∝ (GM/r²)² · [1 - 2GM/(rc²)]^(-2)
```

The "dark matter halo" around a BH is the manifestation of this τ gradient.

### 12.3 Temporal Expansion and BH Evolution

In a universe where τ_cosmic(t) = (t/t₀)^(2/3) increases:

```
BH/cosmic temporal contrast:
Δτ(t) = τ_cosmic(t) - τ_BH ∝ t^(2/3)

The gradient increases with time!
```

**Consequence**: Temporal inversion effects amplify with universe age.

**Prediction**: AGN-induced star formation should be **stronger today** than at z > 2.

---

## 13. Open Questions and Perspectives

### 13.1 Quantum Physics at Horizon

**Question**: How does quantum mechanics behave in the τ → 0 transition?

**Leads**:
- Extreme decoherence at horizon?
- Temporal reference frame superposition?
- Information preserved in temporal structure?

### 13.2 Hawking Radiation Reinterpreted

**In τ_external**: BH emits thermal radiation (Hawking)

**In τ_BH**: Is this radiation the temporal inversion of accretion?

```
Hawking_radiation(τ_external) = -Accretion(τ_BH) · (τ_external/τ_BH)
```

**To explore**: Connection between Hawking temperature and temporal inversion.

### 13.3 Singularity and Null Time

**Central question**: What does τ = 0 physically mean?

**Hypotheses**:
1. **Not a spatial singularity** but a temporal singularity
2. **Absolute reference point** for the entire universe
3. **Interface** between two dual temporal descriptions

**To develop**: Quantum theory of time for τ → 0.

### 13.4 Black Holes and Universe Origin

**Bold speculation**:

If τ_BH = 0 is absolute reference, and if τ_cosmic(t → 0) → 0 at Big Bang...

**Big Bang seen from τ = 0**:
```
Entire universe history is simultaneous
Big Bang = reference state
Expansion = τ increase far from τ = 0
```

**Interpretation**: Black holes preserve "memory" of Big Bang τ = 0 state.

---

## 14. Summary and Conclusions

### 14.1 Fundamental Principles

1. **Black hole is absolute temporal reference** (τ_BH → 0)
2. **Perspective inversion**: destruction in one frame = creation in the other
3. **Mass "exits" the BH** like light from a star (equatorial emission)
4. **Relativistic jets**:
   - Destructive in BH reference frame
   - Creative in external frame (stellar nurseries)

### 14.2 Major Implications

**Cosmological**:
- Black holes = universe temporal anchors
- Crucial role in stellar and galactic formation
- Temporal gradient essential to structuring

**Philosophical**:
- Creation/destruction duality according to frame
- Causality relative to proper time
- Dual universe: no absolute of creation or destruction

### 14.3 Unification with Time Mastery

This black hole cosmology completes the **Theory of Time Mastery**:

```
Temporal expansion (τ_cosmic increasing)
    +
Asselin Liaisons (τ gradients)
    +
Temporal anchors (black holes, τ → 0)
    =
Structured universe with dark matter/energy explained
```

### 14.4 Toward New Understanding

**The black hole is not a "hole"**:
- It's a **temporal reference point**
- A **portal between dual temporal perspectives**
- A **creator through causal inversion**

**Relativistic jets don't destroy**:
- They are destructive in τ_BH
- They are creative in τ_external
- Same process, two valid descriptions

**The universe is fundamentally dual**:
- No creation without destruction
- No destruction without creation
- Everything depends on chosen temporal reference frame

```
